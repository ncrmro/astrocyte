The main goal of Astrocyte in this context is to take baremetal hosts and
turn them into KVM hosts.

Then provision any KVM base guests with admin credentials, snapshot and 
then clone the base guest.

Then we can quickly spin up new pre configured guests for experimentation etc.

An additional goal is to provide cloud provider agnostic Virtual Machines
for things like off site backups, archives, kubernetes workers/ingress nodes.
