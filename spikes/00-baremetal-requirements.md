* Baremetal Requirements


** Dev machine
The first baremetal host we're working with would be your main laptop/desktop of course.

It's a good idea to be working from a static hardline NIC configured with a .local search domain.


** Network
Take a look at your infrastructure. Can you set your router up. Make sure to have all devices plugged in at assigned static IPs if not already configured.
We will also set the OS to use a static IP so if your not able to assign static IPS thats fine.



Hostnames used laters as well need to have - not underscore _
